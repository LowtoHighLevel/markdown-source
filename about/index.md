# About Low To High Level

Low To High Level was founded in October of 2024, as a little side project in order to learn how a computer truly functions. A lot of the early videos were heavily focused on Boolean Algebra, and logic gates, to show how a computer can function with it.

All of these videos were and still are made by Cory Borek with no funding.
