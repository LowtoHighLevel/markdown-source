# Back To Episode Development

## A Quick Update
Hey! It's been a minute since I have made an episode, and that's because I have been busy handling everything in my real life.

About a month ago, I prepared everything I needed to get the next episode ready to record, so it was a matter of just sitting down and doing it.

I'm happy to say that I finally recorded the machine code episode of LTHL!

I think it will be pretty interesting to watch, as we have our first real program working on the machine!

It's pretty simple, as it just prints `hi!` to the screen, but nonetheless, it is really awesme to see!

Next up will be to look into GNU's binutils, which may be either a series of streams, or a full episode, whichever makes the most sense.

I'll see you then!
