# Welcome to the Low To High Level Website

## Welcome!
Today, I created this website for Low To High Level, based on my [personal Markdown site](https://coryborek.github.io/notes/). It's pretty bare bones, and doesn't look very pretty, but it should get the job done for the time being. I'd like to make it look all nice and fancy at some point, but now is not the time.

I decided to take a look at what I made previously with LTHL, and I can never seem to be happy in where I am. I don't know why, but it's probably the perfectionist in me.

I think that the possibilities with Low to High Level are really important, and that I can teach a lot about the fundamentals of computing, so I think I'm going to try to do that.

This will take time, as I am not the best at conveying things, but I think it will be fun.

It is hard to keep a consistent schedule, especially with the new semester popping up, but I think we can achieve a lot.

I'd like to rework the series into a bit more of a lecture-based series, in a format kind of like how [Developed From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/@developedfromscratch) approached their first few videos.

I think I can also take some inspiration from [Hecuba's](https://www.youtube.com/@Hecuba39/videos) style of crafting animation and let's play vibes into this. I think that would be quite enjoyable to watch.

Bringing a whiteboard into the content can also be handy.

In terms of where to begin, we can probably start with Discrete Mathematics. Prepositional logic is a common place to start in these types of courses at the college level, so maybe I'll do an overview on that?

Anyways, I really think that this series can help people, so I'm going to try to make at least one video per month, and work towards some course-based articles.

This may change over time, so we'll see how it goes!

Anyways, that should be it for this first article!
Thanks for reading my blabbering.
