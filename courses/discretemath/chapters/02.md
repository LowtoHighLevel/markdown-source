# Chapter 02 - Propositions

We begin our study of logic with something called a proposition.

A proposition is a statement that can have one or two outcomes, being that it is absolutely true, or absolutely false.

Some examples of this are:

 - The Sky is Blue
 - The Sky is Red
 - 1 + 1 = 2
 - The Moon is made of Cheese.

All of these given cases, are propositions.

Some of them, such as the sky being blue, or 1 + 1 being equal to 2, are true. Others, like the moon being made of cheese, or the sky being red, are false.

Not all sentences are propositions. These may have more than one possible outcome, and may not be true or false.

These may be in the form of questions, an order, or in a mathematical sense, something with a variable.

For example:
 - Who are you?
 - Eat your vegetables
 - $x * 3 = 15$

The mathematical statement may have an answer ($x = 5$), but it is not necessarily true or false, therefore, it is not a proposition.

In discrete math, we can use variables to discuss propositions, which by mathematical convention, we use $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$, though it is not necessarily always the case.

These propositions are everywhere in our world, and can often be used to reason our world.
