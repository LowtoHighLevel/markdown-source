# Low to High Level 101

Welcome to Low To High Level!

This is a series of videos and articles that is aimed to teach you the fundamentals of computing by using its content to reach a single goal.

There is a lot of stuff in the overall computing world that has led us to where we are today. We live in a society where computers are everywhere, guiding us through our day for better or for worse.

Inside the very device that you are reading this from, there's likely millions of tiny transistors working together in harmony to show this article on your screen.

Most likely you are using some sort of web browser to see it, and that page, is the ultimate culmination of years of academic and computing progress.

Low To High Level is about taking you from the very foundations of how these devices function, all the way to the modern era, in where it can run today's software in a powerful state.

We have one long term goal with this series of courses. Every good project needs some sort of goal, so I would like to set this for now. If we pass it, we may find another more advanced goal, but for now, I would like to be able to host a video game server on a custom computer that is connected to the internet.

Of course that is quite a long-term goal, as there is a ton of things we have to do in order to reach it.

As of yet, we know only one thing... That we know nothing!

For every good long-term goal, we need some short-term steps to break things down.

Low to High Level has decided to break this down into a group of series that are hosted both as articles on this website, and as videos on our YouTube Channel.

As a good first step, we should start as simply as possible.

For the first series, you will not need to know how to code. The only prerequisite to this, is that you have some knowledge of Algebra, and mathematics. A lot of it is arithemetic and algebra, with some other rules dotted within.

If you ever get stuck, leave a comment in a video, and I'll try to explain it, or make an article or video explaining these concepts in further detail.

The first major course that we will have will be on Discrete Mathematics. I chose this as a starting ground, as it is a study that we heavily use in the computing world, and every bit of work that a computer can do, we can do with it.

If you are as excited as this as I am, feel free to join us on this adventure!
