# Course Planning

I plan on starting Low To High Level's true story with a course on Discrete Mathematics.

I don't plan on going over the entire topic of the full college course, but just the parts that I think are the most important for our goal in computing.

Perhaps our first true video will be Low To High Level 101.

We will discuss our intention with this series, and set a long term goal.

What will that long-term goal be?

Well, I play a lot of Minecraft, so I think it would be really fun to build a computer that can run a minecraft server that can handle a redstone computer. I think that will provide an interesting challenge in both computer science, and set a fun goal for the end.

That goal, however, is a very far to reach one, and may take multiple years to accomplish.

We will need to take baby steps to get to that point.

A good first step, is to learn how a computer functions, so we can build one.

That is why we will start with the math that powers it all, Discrete Mathematics.
